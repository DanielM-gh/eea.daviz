EEA DaViz - Data Visualisation
=======================================

For the moment been only CSV with tab delimiter will
be converted. The list of accepted formats will be extended
in a further development.

Below are the Excel/CSV rules to be used for the uploaded files:
    * Multiple values must be entered in same cells and with a separator ";"
    * Numbers must use "dot" to indicate decimals, like 50.5, or just without like 50
    * Dates are entered as DD/MM/YEAR like 01/01/2010
    * If necessary use " for quoting
    * If value is unknown for a cell, do not enter anything, leave the cell empty
    * If you have links, just enter the full URL as value

(Longitude and latitude can be entered as well, but this is not for your
case.In case the format is "42.359,-71.093553" in a cell, or in separated
cells. Otherwise enter the full address and we find the coordinates ourselves.)

Task is to make our converter be aware of the above rules.
